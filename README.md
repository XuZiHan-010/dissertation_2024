## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, tables and figures for my researh. The project structure introduces the strucutre of the project and the files under different folders. While the usage part demonstrate what's the function of each script here.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **code/**: Contains all the Python scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Also, the code for converting and processing the data.
- **data/**: Includes all the datasets used in the study. Additioanlly, the converted and processed datasets have also been inclueded here while it can be achieved through our uploaded code as well.
- **figures/**: Contains the output visualizations generated from the analysis.
- **tables/**: Output tables from our research.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, how to use the code, and other relevant information.


## Usage

The main scripts and their purposes are:

- `convert.py`: Script for processing and clean the dataset.
- `road.py`: Plot the Los Angeles County with major roadways.
- `pm2.5.py`: Plot the distribution of pm2.5 data and traffic-related factors.
- `socio_econo.py`: Mapping the distribution of the socioeconomic indicators.
- `commute_mode.py`: Mapping the distribution of the commute mode indicatros.
- `correlation_comparative.py`: Analysis for the correlation and plot the results.
- `comparative_analysis.py`: Comparative analysis and plot the resutls.
- `simulation.py`: Code for the simulation and visualization of it.
- `commute_simulation.py`: Code for the visualize the simulation outputs.
