# Dissertation 2024: [Air Pollution Disparities in Los Angeles County]

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, tables and figures for my researh. T

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **code/**: Contains all the Python scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Also, the code for converting and processing the data.
- **data/**: Includes all the datasets used in the study. Additioanlly, the converted and processed datasets have also been inclueded here while it can be achieved through our uploaded code as well.
- **figures/**: Contains the output visualizations generated from the analysis.
- **tables/**: Output tables from our research.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, how to use the code, and other relevant information.


## Usage

The main scripts and their purposes are:

- `data_processing.py`: Script for cleaning and preprocessing the datasets.
- `analysis.py`: Performs the statistical analysis and modeling.
- `visualization.py`: Generates visualizations used in the dissertation.
- `simulation.py`: Runs simulations of air quality under different scenarios.

You can run these scripts by navigating to the `code/` directory and using the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
